# Martysweight

I have an excel file with all of my (known) recorded weights including te ones I recorded when I was into (extended) intermittent fasting. I want to fit an intuitive model describing my mass as a function of time.

I also have some other datasets scavenged from all around and some results playing with my blood sugar monitor.
